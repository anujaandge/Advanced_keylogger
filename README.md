# Advanced_keylogger
 
 Keyloggers are built for the act of keystroke logging, creating records of everything we type on a computer or mobile keyboard. These are used to quietly monitor our computer activity while using our devices as normal. Keyloggers are used for legitimate purposes like feedback for software development but can be misused by criminals to steal our data.
Keylogging is the necessary tool for a company to protect sensitive data. Advanced keylogging will enable us to be proactive and protect our company from inside out.
A keylogger can also collect data through clipboard logging, screen logging, and internet activity tracking.
Fundamentally, keystroke loggers work exactly as the name suggests. They log every keystroke made on the keyboard, as well as every other action, was taken on the monitored device. Generally, these programs make their way onto computers in one of two ways:
Either the employer purposely installed the software on a system before allocating it to an employee or
It was accidently downloaded as a malicious program through an infected file download.
With either method, the keylogger gets the most useful results if the employee or monitored individual is not aware that it exits in the machine.
